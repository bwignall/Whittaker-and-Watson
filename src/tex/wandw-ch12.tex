\chapter{The Gamma Function} 

12"1. Definitions of the Gamma- function. The Weierstrassian product. 

Historically, the Gamma-function* V z) was first defined by Euler as the 
limit of a product (§ 12*11) from which can be derived the infinite integral 

1 i ~ e~ dt; but in developing the theory of the function, it is more con- 
Jo 

venient to define it by means of an infinite product of Weierstrass' canonical 

form. 



Consider the product ze  fl -I ( 1 -H -

The product under consideration represents an analytic function of z, for 

all values of z ; for, if N be an integer such that \ z\ \    iV, we havef , if n > N,

236 THE TRANSCENDENTAL FUNCTIONS [CHAP. XII 

S ]log(l + -   is an absolutely and uniformly convergent series 

of analytic functions, and so it is an analytic function (§ 5'3) ; con- 
sequently its exponential 11  ( l+-]e~nl is an analytic function, and 

so zey  n  ! ( 1 + - J e ~   [ is an analytic function when \ z\ \   N, where N is 
any integer ; that is to say, the product is analytic for all finite values of z. 
The Gamma-function was defined by Weierstrass* by the equation 

,= -T- = zey  U  ( l+-]e ~n[- 

from this equation it is apparent that T (z) is analytic except at the points 
z=0, — 1, — 2, . . . , where it has simple poles. 

Proofs have been published by Holder t, Moore J, and Bai-nes§ of a theorem known to 
Weierstrass that the Gamma-function does not satisfy any differential equation with 
rational coefficients. 

Example 1. Prove that 

r(i) = i, r'(i)=-y, 

where y is Euler's constant.

12'13. The evaluation of a general class of infinite products. 

By means of the Gamma-function, it is possible to evaluate the general 
class of infinite products of the form 

n Un, 

7t = l 

where Un is any rational function of the index n. 

For, resolving m  into its factors, we can Avrite the product in the form 

* f   (n -a )(n-a2) ...(n- ak) ] 

n=i[ (n-b,).: n-bi) I' 

and it is supposed that no factor in the denominator vanishes. 

In order that this product may converge, the number of factors in the 
numerator must clearly be the same as the number of factors in the 
denominator, and also A  1; for, otherwise, the general factor of the product 
would not tend to the value unity as n tends to infinity. 

We have therefore k= I, and, denoting the product by P, we may \ vrite 

 =i ] n-b ) ...  n-bk)i ' 
The general term in this product can be written 

(- •••(-  )(-r-(-r 

a  + a + ... +ak-b,- ...-bk . 
= 1 — — h Jin  

n 

where  4  is (h~-) when n is large. 

In order that the infinite product may be absolutely convergent, it is 
therefore necessary further (§ 2*7) that 

tti + . . . + Ojk -  1 — • •   -  /fc = 0. 



12 13, 12-14] THE GAMMA FUNCTION 239 

We can therefore introduce the factor 



exp  /i-i ( ! + ... +ak-b,- ... - hk) 



into the general factor of the product, without altering its value ; and thus 
we have

We now proceed to establish another most important property of the 
Gamma-function, expressed by the equation 

r( )r(i-. )= .— .

r(i-z) = -zr(-z) 

we have the result stated. 



240 THE TRANSCENDENTAL FUNCTIONS [CHAP. XII 

Corollary 1. If we assign to z the value \, this formula gives  r( ) 2 = 7r ; since, by 
the formula of Weierstrass, r ( ) is positive, we have

122. Elder s expression of T  z) as an injinite integral. 

The infinite integral I e~H ~ dt represents an analytic function of z when* 

Jo 

the real part of z is positive (§ 5-32); it is called the Eulerian Integral of the 
Second Kindf. It will now be shewn that, when li z)>0, the integral is 
equal to F (z). Denoting the real part of z by x, we have x > 0. Now, if J 

n(z,n)=j'Ul-yJ\'- dt, 

we have U (z, n) = n  l (1 - TyW-'hlr,

12*21. Extension of the infinite integral to the case in which the argument of the 
Gamma-function is negative. 

The formula of the last article is ni> longer applicable when the real part of z is 
negative. Cauchy* and Saalschiitzt have shewn, however, that, for negative arguments, 
an analogous theorem exists. This can be obtained in the following way. 

Consider the function 

r, z)=j\'- (e-'-\ + t- , + ... +  -)>'-  dt, 

where k is the integer so chosen that —k>x>-k-l, x being the real part of z. 
By partial integration we have, when s < — 1, 

r,(.)=[f(.-.-n.<-il + ...+(-r. ,)]; 

+.'j7''( -'-i+'--+(-''(j )* 

The integrated part tends to zero at each limit, since x+k is negative and x + k + l is 
positive : so we have 

r, z) = lT, z+i). 

The same proof applies when x lies between and —1, and leads to the result 

r z+i)=zr2 z) (0>.r>-i). 

The last equation shews that, between the values and —1 of a*, 

To z) = r(z).

244 THE TRANSCENDENTAL FUNCTIONS [CHAP. XII 

The preceding equation then shews that To  z) is the same as T (2) for all negative 
values of Ji z) less than —1. Thus, for all negative values of R(z), we have the result of 
Cauchy and Saalschiitz 

where k is the integer next less than — B (z).

12"22. Hankers expression of V  z) as a contour integral. 

The integrals obtained for T  z) in §§ 12-2, 12-21 are members of a large 
class of definite integrals by which the Gamma-function can be defined. 
The most general integral of the class in question is due to Hankel*; this 
integral will now be investigated. 

Let D be a contour which starts from a point p on the real axis, encircles 
the origin once counter-clockwise and returns to p. 

Consider 1 (—t)~~ e~hlt, when the real part of z is positive and z is not 
an integer. 

The many-valued function (— ty~  is to be made definite by the convention 
that (— ty~  = e' ~ '  °  '"*' and log (— t) is purely real when t is on the negative 
part of the real axis, so that, on D, — ir % arg (— t) % it. 

The integrand is not analytic inside D, but, by § 5'2 corollary 1, the path 
of integration may be deformed (without affecting the value of the integral) 
into the path of integration which starts from p, proceeds along the real axis 
to h, describes a circle of radius h counter-clockwise round the origin and 
returns to p along the real axis. 

On the real axis in the first part of this new path we have arg (—  ) = — tt, 
so that  — ty~'  — e~ ''  ~ H ~  (where log i is purely real); and on the last 
part of the new path (- ty-  = e " ' - ' t ' . 

On the circle we write — i = 8e* ; then we get

J B Jo 

This is true for all positive values of p ; make p  x , and let C be the

J c Jo 

Therefore T ( ) = - r 4 I (- tf-'e-'dt. 

'2i sm TTzJ c 

Now, since the contour C does not pass through the point t = 0, there 
is no need longer to stipulate that the real part of 2 is positive ; and 

I (—ty~ e~ dt is a one-valued analytic function of z for all values of 2. 

J c 

Hence, by § 5"5, the equation, just proved when the real part 0/2 is positive, 
persists for all values of z with the exception of the values 0, ±1, +2 

Consequently, for all except integer values of  , 

r(0) = -\  J — I  -ty-'e-'dt. 

This is Hankel's formula; if we write 1 — 2 for z and make use of § 12"14, 
we get the further result that 

We shall write / for \ , meaning thereby that the path of inte- 

•1 re   C 

gration starts at 'infinity' on the real axis, encircles the origin in the positive 
direction and returns to the starting point.

The integrand in the last integral is continuous as i -  ; and since

integral converges uniformly when the real part of z is posijiive; we may 
consequently integrate from 1 to   under the sign of integration (§ 4*44) and

Consider the application of example 7 of Chapter vii (p. 145) to the

The conditions there stated as sufficient for the transformation of a

if the real part of z be positive ; and we have 

Since !5'( ,   + /i) I is easily seen to be less than K t/n, where Ki is inde-

integrate under the integral sign (§ 4'44) from 1 to z. 

We get 

-I log r (.) = -  ;+ log . + - 2 /;   . JL , 

where C is a constant. Integrating again,

The name Eulerian Integral of the First Kind was given by Legendre to 
the integral 

B (p, q) = f xP-' (1 - x)'i-' dec, 

J 

which was first studied by Euler and Legendre*. In this integral, the real 
parts of p and q are supposed to be positive; and xp~ , (1 — x) ~  are to be 
understood to mean those values of e( ~ ) °°* and e('v-i)'°e(i- =) which correspond 
to the real determinations of the logarithms. 

* Euler, Nov. Comvi. Petrop. xvi. (1772); Legendre, Exercices, i. p. 221. 



254 THE TRANSCENDENTAL FUNCTIONS [CHAP. XII 

With these stipulations, it is easily seen that B (p, q) exists, as a (possibly 
improper) integral (§ 4*5 example 2).

B p,q) = B q,p).

by radii vectores and circular arcs.

12'43. Pochhammers* extension of the Ealerian Integral of the First 
Kind. 

We have seen in § 12'22 that it is possible to replace the second Eulerian 
integral for F  z) by a contour integral which converges for all values of z. 
A similar process has been carried out by Pochhammer for Eulerian integrals 
of the first kind. 

Let P be any point on the real axis between and 1 ; consider the 

integral 

r(i+,o+, 1-, 0-)

The notation employed is that introduced at the end of § 12"22 and 
means that the path of integration starts from P, encircles the point 1 in the 
positive (counter-clockwise) direction and returns to P, then encircles the 
origin in the positive direction and returns to P, and so on.

27r; after the circuit (1 — ) they are lir and and after the circuit (0 — ) they 
are both zero, so that the final vahie of the integrand is the same as the 
initial value. 

It is easily seen that, since the path of integration may be deformed in 
any way so long as it does not pass over the branch points 0, 1 of the 
integrand, the path may be taken to be that shewn in the figure, wherein 
the four parallel lines are supposed to coincide with the real axis.
